# Installing

Run this command from your terminal:

```sh
curl -fsSL https://raw.githubusercontent.com/fwuensche/42-config/master/config.sh | zsh
```

The script does: 

- setup Spectacle shortcuts (e.g, try `cmd+option` plus `]` or `=` or `f`)
- right ctrl key is remapped to right alt (so you can easily navigate words)
- automatically hide the dock and remove its slow animation
- shows disk space left in your 42 account

# Contributing

Here are a few propositions on how to contribute:

- automatically install VS Code from `Managed Software Center` if not installed
- automatically install Spectacle from `Managed Software Center` if not installed
- set mouse right button to `secondary button` (many times it is set to primary)
- set mouse wheel to `button 3` (many times it is turned off)
- set mouse to vertical scroll only
- set keyboard to us international
- require password immediately after sleep or screen saver begins
